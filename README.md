Evaluación Final Paula Álvarez  
This website has been developed according to a design given as the final item of assessment of ADALAB's front-end development bootcamp.

Although it only contains an index.html page and its content consists on placeholders, the site is not fully functional.

However, some buttons have been giving animations and a transition appears when opening the site.

The website has been created using a template engine, partialising its main sections and using parameters and variables in some relevant sections.

It was developed between November 22nd and November 24th by Paula Álvarez.
